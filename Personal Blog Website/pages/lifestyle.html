                                The Louvre in Paris reopened on Wednesday after it was forced to close for three days as staff walked out saying they were concerned about catching the coronavirus from visitors.

                            <p>
                                The museum had been closed since Sunday as staff exercised their right to stay at home under French legislation which allows workers to leave work if they fear there is a clear and imminent danger to their health or safety. </p>
                            <p>
                                “The Louvre museum is open,” it said on its website. The Louvre, which says it is the world’s most visited museum with nearly 10 million visitors a year, presented a plan to staff on Wednesday on preventing coronavirus infection. </p>
